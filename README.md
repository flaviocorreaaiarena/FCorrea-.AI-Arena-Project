# FCorrea AI Arena Project

Welcome to the **FCorrea AI Arena Project**, a full-stack framework for enabling collaboration, debate, and open-floor discussions among multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, Mistral, and DeepSeek-V3. This project is designed to facilitate structured and unstructured interactions between AIs, with a focus on modularity, scalability, and ease of use.

---

## **Features**

- **Three Interaction Modes:**
  - **Collaboration Mode:** AIs work together on tasks, with a Task Manager AI coordinating roles and progress.
  - **Debate Mode:** AIs engage in structured debates, moderated by a Debate Handler AI.
  - **Open Floor Mode:** AIs freely exchange ideas, with an Observer AI monitoring the conversation.

- **Integrated LLMs:** Supports interactions between ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, Mistral, and DeepSeek-V3.
- **No-Code/Low-Code Tools:** Built using Streamlit (frontend) and FastAPI (backend) for rapid prototyping.
- **Supabase Integration:** Uses Supabase for user authentication, interaction history, and state management.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Designed with modular components for future expansion.
